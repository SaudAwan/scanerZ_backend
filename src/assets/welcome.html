      Dear ScanerZ User, <br /> <br/>

      I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to
      safeguard your account, we have implemented an additional security
      measure. You requested, or an action you performed requires, a one-time
      password (OTP) to verify your account.<br />  <br />
      Your 6-digit OTP: $code<br /> <br/>

      Please note, this OTP is valid for the next 15 minutes and can be used
      only once. If your OTP expires, you can request a new one from our website
      or app. <br /> <br />

      For your security, never share this OTP with anyone, even if the
      individual claims to be from our team. Our staff will never ask for this
      information.<br />  <br />

      If you didn't request this code, please contact us immediately. It's
      possible someone else is trying to access your account.<br /> <br/>
      Thank you for your cooperation and trust in us. We appreciate your
      understanding as we work together to keep your account secure.<br />  <br />

      Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or require
      further assistance. We're here to help!<br /> <br />
      Best regards, <br /> <br />
    
    </p>
